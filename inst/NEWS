dynwrap 0.3.0 (19-11-2018)

* MINOR CHANGE: Added metadata on the different wrapper types implemented in dynwrap.

* CLEAN UP: Removed `plot_fun` argument from `create_ti_method()`.

* MINOR CHANGE: Replaced `mc_cores` with more flexible `map_fun`.

* MINOR CHANGE: Renamed `create_ti_method()` to `create_ti_method_r()`, 
  and `create_ti_method_with_container()` to `create_ti_method_container()`.

* CLEAN UP: Drastically reworked `create_ti_method_r()` and `create_ti_method_container()`, 
  and the underlying functions for executing a method on a dataset. 
  
* CLEAN UP: Remove `parse_parameter_definition()` and thereby dependency on ParamHelpers.

dynwrap 0.2.0 (29-10-2018)

* BUG FIX: Fixed incorrect calculation of milestone percentage during trajectory simplification.
  Occurs only in a rare edge case, namely when the order of the milestones in the milestone network
  is very different from the order of the milestone ids (0475e94).

* BUG FIX: Fixed suggested dependencies not being installed in the dynwrap containers (#100).

* FEATURE REMOVAL: Removed feather data format because it's not being used and creates dependency issues every now and again.

* BUG FIX: `devtools:::shim_system.file()` has been moved to `pkgload:::shim_system.file()`.

* TESTING: Solved issue with the unit tests by not using any helpers.

* MINOR CHANGE: Have docker images build from dynwrap@devel.

* BUG FIX: Remove `option(echo = FALSE)` from .Rprofile in recipes because some packages directly rely 
  on standard output from R, so printing the command wreaks havoc.

dynwrap 0.1.0 (07-03-2018)

* INITIAL RELEASE: dynwrap, functionality for containerised trajectory inference.
 - Wrap the input data of a trajectory inference method, such as expression and prior information
 - Run a trajectory inference method in R, in a docker container or a singularity container
 - Wrap the output of a trajectory inference method, such as the pseudotime, a clustering or a branch network, and convert it into a common trajectory model
 - Further postprocess the trajectory model, such as labelling the milestones and rooting the trajectory
