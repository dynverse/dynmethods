\arguments{
\item{cluster_method}{. Domain: {pam, clara}. Default: pam. Format: character.}

\item{ndim}{The number of dimensions in the new space. Domain: U(2, 100).
Default: 20. Format: integer.}

\item{shrink}{Logical or numeric between 0 and 1, determines whether and how
much to shrink branching lineages toward their average prior to the split.
Domain: e^U(-Inf, 0.00). Default: 1. Format: numeric.}

\item{reweight}{Logical, whether to allow cells shared between lineages to be
reweighted during curve-fitting. If \code{TRUE}, cells shared between lineages will
be weighted by: distance to nearest curve / distance to curve. Default: TRUE.
Format: logical.}

\item{reassign}{Logical, whether to reassign cells to lineages at each
iteration. If TRUE, cells will be added to a lineage when their projection
distance to the curve is less than the median distance for all cells currently
assigned to the lineage. Additionally, shared cells will be removed from a
lineage if their projection distance to the curve is above the 90th percentile
and their weight along the curve is less than 0.1. Default: TRUE. Format:
logical.}

\item{thresh}{Numeric, determines the convergence criterion. Percent change in
the total distance from cells to their projections along curves must be less
than thresh. Default is 0.001, similar to principal.curve. Domain: e^U(-11.51,
11.51). Default: 0.001. Format: numeric.}

\item{maxit}{Numeric, maximum number of iterations, see principal.curve.
Domain: U(0, 50). Default: 10. Format: integer.}

\item{stretch}{Numeric factor by which curves can be extrapolated beyond
endpoints. Default is 2, see principal.curve. Domain: e^U(-Inf, 1.61). Default:
2. Format: numeric.}

\item{smoother}{Choice of scatter plot smoother. Same as principal.curve, but
"lowess" option is replaced with "loess" for additional flexibility. Domain:
{smooth.spline, loess, periodic.lowess}. Default: smooth.spline. Format:
character.}

\item{shrink.method}{Character denoting how to determine the appropriate amount
of shrinkage for a branching lineage. Accepted values are the same as for
\code{kernel} in \code{density()} (default is \code{"cosine"}), as well as \code{"tricube"} and
\code{"density"}. See 'Details' for more. Domain: {cosine, tricube, density}.
Default: cosine. Format: character.}
