  distance_method:
    type: discrete
    default: euclidean
    values:
    - euclidean
    - cosine
    - pearson
    - spearman
    - L1
    - MI
    description: Distance method to be used. The available distances are the Euclidean
      distance (method="euclidean"), Manhattan distance (also called L1 distance,
      method="L1"), cosine distance (method="cosine") , distance based on Pearson
      (method="pearson") or Spearman (method="spearman") correlation coefficients,
      and distance based on Mutual Information (method="MI"). Intervals used to assess
      Mutual Information are indicated in the parameter 'bins'.
  dimred_method:
    type: discrete
    default: none
    values:
    - none
    - PCA
    - ICA
    - tSNE
    - classical-MDS
    - nonmetric-MDS
    description: 'Dimensionality reduction algorithm to be used. Options are: Principal
      Component Analysis (method="PCA"), Independent Component Analysis (method="ICA";
      using fastICA() function in fastICA package), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
      Embedding (method="tSNE"; using Rtsne() function in Rtsne package with parameters
      tsne.perplexity=1 and tsne.theta=0.25), classical Multidimensional Scaling (method="classical-MDS";
      using the cmdscale() function) and non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (method="nonmetric-MDS";using
      the isoMDS() function in MASS package). if method="PCA" is chosen, the proportion
      of variance explained by each of the principal axes is plotted. We note that
      Sincell makes use of the Rtsne implementation of the Barnes-Hut algorithm, which
      approximates the likelihood. The user should be aware that this is a less accurate
      version of t-SNE than e.g. the one used as basis of viSNE (Amir,E.D. et al.
      2013, Nat Biotechnol 31, 545-552).'

    description: "\nIf clust.method=\"max.distance\", clusters are defined as subgraphs

      pairs of cells connected by a distance lower than a given threshold.\n\nIf clust.method=\"percent\",
      clusters are defined as subgraphs generated by a given rank-percentile of the
      shortest pair-wise distances, that is; from a totally connected graph where
      all cells are connected to each other, the algorithm only keeps the top 'x'
      percent of shortest pairwise distances as indicated by \"shortest.rank.percent\".\n\nIf
      clust.method=\"knn\", unsupervised K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) clustering is
      performed: From a totally disconnected graph where none of the cells are connected
      to each other, the algorithm connects each cell to its 'k' nearest neighbors.
      If parameter \"mutual=TRUE\", Unsupervised K-Mutual Nearest Neighbours (K-MNN)
      clustering is performed, that is: only reciprocal k nearest neighbors are connected.\n\nIf
      clust.method=\"k-medoids\", clustering around medoids (a more robust version
      of k-means) is performed with function \"pam\" from package \"cluster\" on the
      distance matrix in mySincellObject$cell2celldist with a desired number of groups
      indicated in parameter \"num.clusters\"\n\nHierarchical agglomerative clustering
      can be performed by internally calling function \"hclust\" where the agglomeration

      \"single\", \"complete\", \"average\" (= UPGMA), \"mcquitty\" (= WPGMA), \"median\"
      (= WPGMC) or \"centroid\" (= UPGMC). Clusters are obtained by cutting the tree

      in parameter \"num.clusters\" \n\n"

      If graph.using.cells.clustering=TRUE and graph.algorithm="MST" or graph.algorithm="MST", a precalculated clustering of cells is used. The clustering of cells is taken from SincellObject$cellsClustering as calculated by function sc_clusterObj().
