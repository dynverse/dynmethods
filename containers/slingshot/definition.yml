parameters:
  ndim:
    type: integer
    default: 3
    upper: 20
    lower: 2
    description: The number of dimensions
  nclus:
    type: integer
    default: 5
    upper: 40
    lower: 2
    description: Number of clusters
  dimred:
    type: discrete
    default: pca
    values:
    - pca
    - mds
    - tsne
    - ica
    - lle
    - mds_sammon
    - mds_isomds
    - mds_smacof
    - umap
    description: |-
      A character vector specifying which dimensionality reduction method to use.
      See \code{\link{dyndimred:dimred}} for the list of available dimensionality reduction methods.
  shrink:
    type: numeric
    default: 1.0
    upper: 1.0
    lower: 0.0e+00
    description: "logical or numeric between 0 and 1, determines whether and how \nmuch
      to shrink branching lineages toward their average prior to the split."
  reweight:
    type: logical
    default: yes
    values:
    - 'TRUE'
    - 'FALSE'
    description: "logical, whether to allow cells shared between lineages to be\nreweighted
      during curve-fitting. If \\code{TRUE}, cells shared between \nlineages will
      be weighted by: distance to nearest curve / distance to\ncurve."
  thresh:
    type: numeric
    default: -3.0
    upper: 5.0
    lower: -5.0
    description: numeric, determines the convergence criterion. Percent change in
      the total distance from cells to their projections along curves must be less
      than thresh. Default is 0.001, similar to principal.curve.
  maxit:
    type: integer
    default: 10
    upper: 50
    lower: 0
    description: numeric, maximum number of iterations, see principal.curve.
  stretch:
    type: numeric
    default: 2.0
    upper: 5.0
    lower: 0.0e+00
    description: numeric factor by which curves can be extrapolated beyond endpoints.
      Default is 2, see principal.curve.
  smoother:
    type: discrete
    default: smooth.spline
    values:
    - smooth.spline
    - loess
    - periodic.lowess
    description: choice of scatter plot smoother. Same as principal.curve, but "lowess"
      option is replaced with "loess" for additional flexibility.
  shrink.method:
    type: discrete
    default: cosine
    values:
    - cosine
    - tricube
    - density
    description: |-
      character denoting how to determine the appropriate
      amount of shrinkage for a branching lineage. Accepted values are the same
      as for \code{kernel} in [density()] (default is \code{"cosine"}),
      as well as \code{"tricube"} and \code{"density"}. See 'Details' for more.
